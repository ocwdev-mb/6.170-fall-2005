A major component of 6.170 is the final project, counting for 35% of the student's total grade. Students work in teams, and all team members receive the same project grade. Although full collaboration on all aspects of the final project is permitted, every member of the team is expected to contribute a roughly equal share to the design and implementation. Each team may enter its final project implementation into a class contest for an award.
