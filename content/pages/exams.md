The quiz (given in week 9) will be a closed-book quiz. Here is a list of topics that have been covered this term that may appear in the quiz. You won't be tested on obscure details of Java.

Basic Programming Notions
-------------------------

*   Assignment semantics, aliasing and sharing
*   Class hierarchy, dynamic dispatch, inheritance
*   Subclasses and interfaces
*   Exceptions, checked and unchecked
*   Namespace and access control mechanisms
*   Static variables and methods
*   Constructors; references to this and super object
*   Hash tables and hash codes
*   Casts and runtime type checks
*   Overloading of method names
*   Runtime assertions
*   Subtyping in Java
*   Deep vs. shallow copying
*   Reference vs. value equality
*   Parametric polymorphism

Specification
-------------

*   Declarative vs. operational specification
*   The relational model of behavior
*   Preconditions and postconditions
*   Frame conditions
*   Standard syntax for specifications
*   Non-deterministic or 'underdetermined' specifications
*   The idea of substitutability
*   The refinement ordering
*   Subtypes vs. subclasses
*   Co- and contra-variance
*   The object contract

Abstract Data Types
-------------------

*   The idea of representation independence
*   Encapsulating the representation
*   Representation invariants
*   Classification of operations into constructors, mutators, observers
*   Abstraction functions
*   Representation exposure
*   Arguments by structural induction
*   Mutable and immutable types
*   Beneficent side effects
*   Notions of equality
*   The basic idea of algebraic specification

Object Models
-------------

*   Instances versus models
*   Multiplicity constraints
*   Final markings

Module Dependency Diagrams
--------------------------

*   The dependence relation
*   Dependences mediated by specifications
*   Effect of dependence structure on division of labor, reuse, reasoning, testing
*   Decoupling by weakening dependences

Design Patterns
---------------

*   The idea of design patterns
*   Effect of design patterns on dependences
*   Composite, Decorator, Iterator, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Strategy, Template

Testing
-------

*   Oracles, stubs and drivers
*   Kinds of testing: unit testing, regression testing, etc.
*   Basic notion of coverage
*   Value and limitations of testing
*   Code-based vs. specification-based testing

Usability
---------

*   Basic principles
*   Simple cognitive model and its consequences
*   Standard heuristics
*   Methods for improving usability
