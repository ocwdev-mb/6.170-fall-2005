Recommended Textbooks
---------------------

There are no required textbooks. We recommend two books:

Liskov, Barbara, and John Guttag. _Program Development in Java: Abstraction, Specification, and Object-Oriented Design_. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 2000. ISBN: 0201657686.

Bloch, Joshua. _Effective Java: Programming Language Guide_. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 2001. ISBN: 0201310058.

The Liskov book parallels the course material closely; it's a good book for background reading. The Bloch book explains, in about 60 short items, some key ideas in program style, as well as some subtleties of Java; it's perhaps better appreciated when you have some familiarity with Java and want to delve deeper.

Software Engineering References
-------------------------------

Some other excellent books you should consider for your reference library on software engineering are:

Gamma, Erich, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides. _Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1995. ISBN: 0201633612.  
The seminal book on design patterns, usually referred to as the "Gang of Four book". Organized as a catalog.

Fowler, Martin. _Analysis Patterns: Reusable Object Models_. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley Professional, 1996. ISBN: 0201895420.  
A book on object models of problems, organized in the style of the "Gang of Four book". Notation differs slightly from the notation we'll use, but that shouldn't be a major obstacle.

———. _Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code_. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1999. ISBN: 0201485672.  
A book on techniques for restructuring code to make it more readable, extensible, and maintainable without changing its meaning. Particularly helpful for those coming from a non-object-oriented background. Examples are presented in Java.

Jackson, Michael. _Software Requirements and Specifications_. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley and ACM Press, 1995. ISBN: 0201877120.  
A collection of short and entertaining essays on software development. One of the only books to explain clearly the difference between 'requirements' and 'specifications'.

Learning Java
-------------

The course is not about Java, but you will be need to learn Java in the first week or so. Some books you might find helpful are:

Horton, Ivor. _Beginning Java 2: JDK 5 Edition_. New York, NY: Wiley Publishing, 2004. ISBN: 0764568744.

Flanagan, David, and Brett McLaughlin. _Java 1.5 Tiger: A Developer's Notebook_. Cambridge, MA: O'Reilly Publishing, 2004. ISBN: 0596007388.  
This book can also be read online on Safari through MIT Libraries (requires certificates).

The Flanagan and McLaughlin book should suit those who already know some Java (we will be using Java 5 this term). Those who don't know Java are better off with the Horton book, which is a self-contained tutorial for the language.

A more advanced book on Java, which just came out is:

Bloch, Joshua, and Neal Gafter. _Java Puzzlers: Traps, Pitfalls, and Corner Cases_. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley Professional, 2005. ISBN: 032133678X.  
It contains a very entertaining and thought-provoking collection of puzzlers that elucidate subtle aspects of Java.

Java References
---------------

Other books on Java include:

Arnold, Ken, James Gosling, and David Holmes. _The Java Programming Language_. 3rd ed. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 2000. ISBN: 0201704331.  
A brief explanation of Java. Assumes more background; much less explanation about how to use Java's features. User interface libraries are not discussed. Details [online](http://java.sun.com/docs/books/javaprog/).

Gosling, James, Bill Joy, and Guy Steele. _The Java Language Specification_. 3rd ed. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 2005. ISBN: 0321246780.  
The official reference for Java by its inventors. Good for reference, but not an easy way to learn Java. Available as a book, or [online](http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/index.html).

Flanagan, David. _Java in a Nutshell_. 4th ed. Cambridge, MA: O'Reilly Publishing, 2002. ISBN: 0596002831.  
A reference book rather than a tutorial. Succinct but covers a lot. Assumes knowledge of a language like C. Details [online](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/javanut4/).

Eckel, Bruce. _Thinking in Java_. 3rd ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2002. ISBN: 0131002872.
