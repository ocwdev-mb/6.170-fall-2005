Students are taught a programming method based on the recognition and description of useful abstractions. Topics include modularity, specification, data abstraction, object modeling, design patterns, and testing. Students complete several programming projects of varying size, working individually and in groups.\n\nStudents are now introduced to software engineering in _6.005 Elements of Software Construction_, which is available on OCW in two versions, as taught in [Fall 2008](/courses/6-005-elements-of-software-construction-fall-2008/) and Fall 2011.\n",
